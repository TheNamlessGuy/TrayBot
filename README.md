# TrayBot
A bot that lives in your system tray and eats your input, barfing out some cool stuff in response

## But what does that even mean?
Well, you can press a combo of buttons (currently locked to CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+Q) to bring up a textbox, in which you can type things. Depending on what you type, the bot does things!  
What it does highly depends on what you have inputted and told it to do in case of that input before, though.

For example, you can set it so if you write "music" into the box, it opens your music folder.  
Or perhaps you set it to start the calculator when you write "calc".  
Maybe when you write "tm", the bot copies the trademark symbol into your clipboard.

Your imagination (and the available actions) are the only limitations!

## Example usage
1. Right click the icon in your system tray
2. Choose "Add New" from the list
3. In the new window, type your keyword into the box
4. Then choose your type of action (Open Directory, Set Clipboard, etc).
5. Press "OK"
6. In the new window (which will be different based on what you chose in 4), follow the instructions, and then press "OK"
7. If you get a "Success" message, you did it right.
8. Right click the icon again, this time selecting "List All"
9. Check that the new keyword is in the list
10. Press the button combo (CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+Q), input your keyword and voila, it does what you told it to do
