# TrayBot
A bot that lives in your system tray and eats your input, barfing out some cool stuff in response

## But what does that even mean?
Well, you can press a combo of buttons (currently CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+Q) to bring up a textbox, in which you can type things. Depending on what you type, the bot does things!
What it does highly depends on what you have inputted and told it to do in case of that input before, though.

## Example usage
1. Right click on the icon in your system tray
2. Choose "Add New" from the list
3. In the new window [[ERROR THIS ISNT FIXED YET]]
4. Then press the button combo (CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+Q), input what you put as the parameter before, and voila, it does what you want it to do.
